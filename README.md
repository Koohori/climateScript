### Includes:
- simple model
	- assumes that there is temporary increase in the consistent solar constant, or the amount of insolation arriving from the sun

- main.py
	- climate change occurs due to the retention of more heat
	- is more realistic by decreasing the albedo of earth and increasing the emmisivity
	- (in relation to what occurs during global warming)
